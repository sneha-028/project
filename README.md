Project work description
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool that determines body fat levels based on height and weight. It uses the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²). The result categorizes individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, helping assess health risks. While simple and widely used, it doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density, or fat distribution. It’s useful for general guidance but should be combined with other health indicators for a complete assessment.
